# CS6675

This repo holds a final prototype for OMS CS6675: Advanced Internet Computing Systems and Application Development. 

It's a prototype which calls different Google API endpoints to render 'essential places nearby' with the goal of having this information before making a stay reservation through the website of your choice (e.g.: Airbnb, VRBO).

Essential places include:

- Grocery Shopping
- Gas Stations
- Health related (Urgent care, hospitals)
- Parks
- Pharmacies

Download all three files in the same place. No need for a webserver, just internet connection.
